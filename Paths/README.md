## Interacting with AWS
Logically manage infrastructure through AWS Application Programming Interface (AWS API) to create, delete, or change any AWS resource. Here are some ways we interact with AWS:
- AWS Management Console (we-based)
- AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) ([AWS CloudShell](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/?pg=cloudessentials))
- IDE and IDE Toolkits
- AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs)

## Cloud Computing
> "Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS)."

There's a variety of use cases for cloud computing: data backup, databases, disaster recovery, email, virtual desktops, software development and testing, big data analytics, and customer-facing web-applications.


## Advantages
**Agility**
Quickly adapt and spin up resources as needed, so there is a lot of room for experimentation and testing new ideas.

**Elasticity**
Scale resources up or down based on demand, meaning the resources can easily size to business needs.

**Cost Savings**
Trading fixed expenses and hardware overhead costs for variable expenses based on business needs. 

**Global Deployments**
Easily expand to new geographic regions reducing latency for users in other regions.

## Types of Cloud Computing
**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
Contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. It provides access to networking features, virtual computers, dedicated hardware, and or data storage space. IaaS provides the highest level of flexibility and management control over IT resources.

**Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
Focus is on the deployment and management of applications, removing the need to manage most infrastructure (hardware or operating systems). This is more efficient as there's less concern about obtaining resources, capacity planning, software maintenance, or patching.

**Software as a Service (SaaS)**
Provides a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider, usually end-user applications. There's no concern how the service is maintained or how the infrastructure is managed; it is only about the particular software.

## Cloud (Managed) Services
IT resources managed by a cloud provider (AWS) delivered on demand over the internet. Through cloud services, it is much easier to build and maintain digital systems to build applications quickly and scale globally.

All required hardware, operating systems, and other infrastructure layers are stored and managed in highly secure AWS data centers around the world. Anyone can build and deploy software without heavy upfront IT infrastructure investments. 

## Examples of Cloud Services Offered by AWS
**Resizable Compute Capacity**
Access and configure compute cappacity as a fully managed cloud service. AWS provides hundreds of cloud instance types with the latest processors, operating systems, and purchase models to best match needs.

**Databases and Data Storage**
Cloud services include secure, reliable, and highly scalable database options and data storage solutions for file, block, and object storage systems. AWS also has cloud services for both SQL and NoSQL databases.

**Artificial Intelligence Learning**
AI infrastructure for all training and inference needs for interactive chatbots, virtual assistants, conversational and predictive analytics, and agent assistance. Other examples include conversational search, code generation, and automated report generation.

**Networking and Content Delivery** 
Deliver applications and content anywhere in the world while simplifying networking environments and distributing network traffic more efficiently.

**Security, Identity, and Compliance**
Protect accounts, workloads, and data from unauthorized access. AWS can help enforce fine-grained policies at network control points and continuously monitor with automated compliance checks.

**Migration and Modernization**
AWS migration service provide automation and intelligent recommendations to convert source servers to run natively on AWS, run natively on AWS, perform non-disruptive tests, and move applications to the cloud.
